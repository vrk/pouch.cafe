# About Pouch Cafe

Hello friend, my name is **vrk**! I love making zines and other paper things (and other non-paper things too). I occasionally daydream about opening a real (like brick & mortar) zine store slash stationery cafe... but that sounds like a lot of work ðŸ˜†

So I decided to make a tiny online store instead!

Welcome to Pouch Cafe!! It is the home of [Pouch](/pouch) zine, which is also the namesake of the store. It is home to some [other things](https://pouchcafe.gumroad.com/) too!

I'm running this store just for fun as a passion project. I hope you get as much joy out of it as I do ðŸ’–
