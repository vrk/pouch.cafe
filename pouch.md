# About _Pouch_ Magazine

_Pouch_ is an independent [fanzine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine) about paper and stationery ✂️ It features product reviews, journaling ideas, cool new stationery/stickers/notebooks to check out,  DIYs, and more.

I am a huge fan of paper and stationery, and I thought, what better way to share a love of paper than through a paper medium: magazines!

Currently, _Pouch_ is 100% written, designed, illustrated, and produced by a team of one: **me, vrk**! It is a passion project and a labor of love 💖
