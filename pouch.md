## About the project

Currently, _Pouch_ is 100% written, designed, illustrated, and produced by a team of one: me, vrk! It is a passion project and a labor of love üíñ

I am a huge fan of paper and stationery, and I thought, what better way to share a love of paper than through a paper medium: magazines!

‚úèÔ∏è I'd love to [invite contributors](/contribute) for the first issue!
